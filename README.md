# <TEAM-BUILD>

## Description

In this Node project, a user can enter employee information in their terminal and create teams. I built this as an easy way to log and keep track of employees in a workplace. This project taught me more about writing tests, how to use inquirer and node.js

## Installation

To use this app Node.js, inquirer and Jest must all be installed.

## Usage

In order to use, simply type "node index" in the terminal, this will run the program. Then enter in the information when prompted. Decide how large you would like your team to be, and add engineers and interns accordingly. When finished select the "no" option from the menu and it will write the HTML. In order to run the tests. 'cd' into the tests folder and type "npm run test" this will run the tests in the folder.
